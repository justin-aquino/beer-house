# Beer House
GA- SEI Project 2
## Why I chose this project.
For my second GA Project, I decided to build a fullstack app that tracks the artisan beers the user has tried. The inspiration behind the app goes back to my experience as a chef where after every busy shift, employees share a few pints of beer while cleaning the kitchen to reward ourselves for our hard work.

## As a user, I want to be able to:
1. Search different beers and read their description.
2. Track the beer I have tried and rate them.
3. Make a review of the beer that I tried.

## MVP 
1. Fetch from punk api.
2. Display and search data.
3. Add beer to tracker list.
    In the tracker list:
        a. Delete a beer from the list.
        b. Update the added beer.
        c. Click on a beer and show the details.
4. In show.ejs, render the following:
        a. name
        b. user review
        c. description
        d. Yeast type

5. Sign up, Log in where user can only access their own beer tracker.

## STRETCH GOALS
1. Make a trending beer page where you can upvote and downvote beers.
