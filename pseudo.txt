// user.belongsToMany(beers) and vice versa


FOO-bar

QUESTIONS TO ASK ON WEDNESDAY:

// ASK SOMEONE HOW TO REMOVE A COLUMN FROM A TABLE.
// YOU DONT NEED THE TYPE COLUMN ON BEERS, CHANGE IT TO IMG SRC
//Also the manufacturer, exchange it to yeast.
//help modify the dbTest.js


STAND UP:
3/2
Users db connected, sign in sign up sign out working. Missing: protected routes.
join tables done (in theory it should be working, I just need help with the dbTest.js to check if it's actually working)


to do:
Check if users_beers join tables is working.
create a model for reviews and make join tables for that.
road blocks:
I have to redo my beers table since the api does not return beer types or manufacturer.


1. findOne user > include:beer > getBeer()?
